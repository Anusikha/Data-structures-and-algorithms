Codes done on questions below:

Q1) Assume in the Regional Passport Office, a multitude of applicants arrive each day for passport renewal. A list is maintained in the database to store the renewed passports arranged in the increased order of passport ID. The list already would contain there cords renewed till the previous day. Apply Insertion sort technique to place the current dayâ€™s records in the list. Later the office personnel wish to sort the records based on the date of renewal so as to know the count of renewals done each day. Taking into consideration the fact that each record has several fields (around 25 fields), follow Selection sort logic to implement the same.
1. Implement any one of the sorting technique
2. Implement the problem for both the sorting t echniques

Q2) To facilitate thorough net surfing, any web browser has back and forward buttons that allow the user to move backward and forward through a series of web pages. To allow the user to move both forward and backward two stacks are employed. When the user presses the back button, the link to the current web page is stored on a separate stack for the forward button. As the user moves backward through a series of previous pages, the link to each page is moved in turn from the back to the forward stack. When the user presses the forward button, the action is the reverse of the back button. Now the item from the forward stack is popped and becomes the current web page. The previous web page is pushed on the back stack. Simulate the functioning of these buttons using array implementation of Stack. Also, provide options for displaying the contents of both stacks whenever required.
